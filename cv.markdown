## Summary

I am a software engineer with lots of experience using Haskell, both
professionally and for open source projects. Strong typing and functional
programming have helped me achieve a rigorous attitude towards programming –
not only in Haskell, but also in other languages I use such as Java, C, C++,
OCaml and JavaScript – by constantly striving towards correctness, principled
design, and robustness. My personal development projects include high-profile
Haskell libraries, and a technical blog.

## Skills

- **Functional programming**: I have a deep and broad experience with Haskell,
  as I have applied it many different areas ranging from High Frequence Trading
  to Web Programming.

- **Imperative programming**: Problems should be solved in the *right* way. This
  means that at many occasions, I have had to dive into low-level and system
  programming.

- **Object-oriented programming**: My experiences with functional languages have
  taught me many new and valuable lessons about object-oriented programming and
  design. I believe these lessons will be extremely valuable now that parallel
  programming has become ubiquitous.

- **System administration**: For years, I have been using Linux-based operating
  systems such as Debian and Archlinux to manage personal servers. This
  experience proved very useful when I later learned to manage deployments to
  multiple servers using tools such as Ansible, Puppet and NixOps.

- **Front end**: As a full-stack engineer, I have also become fluent with
  front-end programming, with e.g. JavaScript (though I prefer TypeScript) and
  CSS (though I prefer tools such as LESS).

- **Soft skills**: I am fluent in Dutch and English, both spoken and written.
  have volunteered in different nonprofits, so I am confident in my teamwork and
  organizational skills.

- **Other skills**: Relational databases, NoSQL databases, version control
  systems, scripting...

## Education

- **Ghent University** (2011 - 2013):
  Master in Computer Science: Software Engineering, graduated with high
  distinction

- **Ghent University** (2008 - 2011):
  Bachelor in Computer Science, graduated with high distinction

- **Sint-Lodewijkscollege Lokeren** (2002 - 2008):
  Secondary school: ASO, with Latin & maths specialization

## Technical work experience

- **Better** (2013 - 2014): In September 2013, I started as a full-stack
  Software Engineer at [Better] (previously known as *Erudify*). I mostly worked
  on the Haskell backend and business logic.

- **Tsuru Capital LLC** (2012): I did a internship as a programmer at [Tsuru
  Capital LLC], a proprietary trading fund based in Tokyo and Singapore. This
  position taught me a lot about desiging large applications, and how to make my
  code run *fast*.

- **Google Summer of Code** (2010 - 2011): I participated in [Google Summer of
  Code] twice, in 2010 and 2011. In both cases, I worked for a Haskell project
  and was positively evaluated.

- **Amplidata** (2011): I worked as a Software Engineer at [Amplidata] as a
  summer job. This involved extending their proprietary Distributed Storage
  System with an NFS frontend, written in [OCaml].

## Open source contributions

- **[Hakyll]**: I wanted a custom system for my personal homepage,
  so I wrote Hakyll, a static site generator in Haskell.

- **[blaze-builder]**: Simon Meier and I developed an initial version of a
  fast builder monoid for the [BlazeHtml] project. This library is now used in
  many Haskell projects. Simon is the current maintainer.

- **[blaze-html]**: a blazingly fast HTML combinator library for the Haskell
  programming language. I worked on this project for
  [Google Summer of Code] 2010.

- **[Text]**: I worked on the text library as a [Google Summer of Code]
  student, creating a port which uses UTF-8 internally, and doing extensive
  benchmarking to discover the trade-offs between the different encodings.

- **[websockets]**: I created a library for easily writing
  robust WebSocket-capable servers in Haskell.

Apart from these projects, I have also authored or co-authored
[stylish-haskell], [Digestive functors], [psqueues], [Lorem Markdownum],
[geohub.github.com], [12Urenloop], [JVGS], and more. I have also made
contributions to many Haskell libraries and tools. Most info can be found on my
[GitHub page], and I would be glad to provide details on request.

## Community involvement

Apart from the technical blog I maintain at
[jaspervdj.be](http://jaspervdj.be/), I have also given a lot of talks at
various conferences and user groups. My talks have almost exclusively been
around Haskell, and I have spoken in Ghent, Utrecht, Cambridge, New York, London
and Zürich. I would be happy to provide a full list of topics and slides on
request.

During the time I was at [Ghent University], I was in the organizing committee
of the students' Computer Science Workgroup, [Zeus WPI], as well as the
organizing committee of the [Ghent Functional Programming Group].
