title: Hakyll 4.0
description: New major release of the Haskell static site generator
tags: haskell
---

After a few weeks of [beta status], I've now released version 4.0 of the
[Hakyll] static site generator library. I'm really glad with this release, as
from what I've found and heard, it makes many things a lot easier.

# Main changes

- The important `Compiler` type has been changed from `Arrow` to `Monad`: this
  makes it much easier to write custom compilers, as most Haskellers are more
  familiar with monads.

- The template stays superficially the same, but it has grown much more powerful
  and flexible underneath.

- Early and fast access to metadata makes things such as tags and pagination
  much easier.

- All items (images, css...) can now have metadata associated. Metadata can no
  longer be manipulated, and this immutability should reduce the number of
  encountered bugs.

- A `check` command has been added. This allows you to check that all internal
  (or external) links are still alive.

# Installation, migration

In order to install Hakyll 4, grab it from Hackage:

    cabal update
    cabal install hakyll
