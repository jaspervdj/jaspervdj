# The problem

In a far away mountain, there was a large dwarven colony. At the time when this
story took place, not a lot of dwarfs still lived there, though. The dwarven
complex was huge, full of dark corridors, hidden tunnels and no longer used
rooms. The dwarfs that were left, lived in a small number of rooms deep inside
the complex.

But legends say that a lot of treasures, long forgotten, remained hidden in
a handful of the supposedly 20,000 rooms making up the complex. Due to the
massiveness of the complex, it was an impossible task for the dwarfs to search
all rooms, so they sent out random expeditions.

# A naive solution

Being with so few, the dwarfs did not want to visit a room twice, for their time
was too valuable. So, they wanted a computer program with which they could mark
the rooms they have already been to. One of the younger dwarfs quickly came up
with a solution.

However, the dwarven council was not pleased with this solution. The young dwarf
had used Java (the older dwarfs really don't like Java), but aside from that,
the older dwarfs quickly found out that the algorithm would run in _O(n)_ time,
with _n_ being the total number of rooms in the complex (20,000).

"Indeed," the young dwarf spoke, "the algorithm will take _O(n)_ to initialize
the marks array". "We can't have that," the dwarven council answered, "we have
too many rooms and too little time."

For completeness reasons, here was the simple code that the young dwarf had
written:

~~~~~{.java}
public class Marker {
    private boolean[] marks;

    public Marker(int size) {
        marks = new boolean[size];
    }

    public void mark(int index) {
        marks[index] = true;
    }

    public boolean isMarked(int index) {
        return marks[index];
    }
}

# Abusing malloc's complexity

One of the older dwarven lords then spoke, wise as he was: "This is inherent
to Java -- you should try to use C. `malloc` will run in _O(1)_, and this will
solve the problem."

The young dwarf shoke his head, speaking "You ask me to do the impossible. If
the array is not initialized -- and thus filled with random elements -- we
cannot know if a mark has been set! If you think this can be done, why don't you
show it to us?"

The dwarven lord spoke again "It is possible, but I am far too old to be kept
busy with these kind of problems -- I suggest you think it over again, it is not
very hard, and it will be a good exercise."

# The solution

<button onclick="document.getElementById('solution').style.display='block';">
<strong>Spoiler warning: Click here to reveal the solution.</strong>
</button>

<div id="solution" style="display: none">

The solution of the dwarven lord goes a bit like this: two arrays of the
requested size are allocated. We shall call one `array` and the other one
`marks`. They are both filled with random elements, since we do not want to
initialize them.

The `array` can be compared to the array used in the Java program, except all
values are initially random integers.

In addition to the `marks` array, we keep the number of marks set. Initially,
this number is 0. All values in the `marks` array are random integers, too.

When we want to mark an item, instead of setting the corresponding element
of `array` to `true`, we let it point to the next position in `marks` and we
increment the number of marks. Now, we have this element in `marks` point back
to the element in `array`. This way, an element in `array` can, by chance, point
to an element in `marks`, but this won't matter since the element in `marks`
won't point back, and so we can determine it's fake.

This figure illustrates the algorithm. Only one element is marked: the fourth
element. Therefore, only one element from the `marks` structure is used (the
number is set to 1). All elements in the `array` except the fourth element point
to random positions. The fourth points to the first mark (since we set the
fourth mark).

By chance, the second element in `array` also points to the first mark. However,
we can easily see that only the fourth element is marked, since the first mark
points back to the fourth element in `array`.

Here is [an implementation in C](http://gist.github.com/471529).

# Update

Since there's been a lot of comments, here is a small update.

First off, this algorithm will **never return an incorrect result**. There will
be no false positives nor false negatives.

Now, on the complexity. The time complexity is roughly the same as for most set
implementations (hashset, treeset): _O(1)_ initialization, _O(1)_ add/contains
and _O(m)_ traversal (with _m_ the number of elements in the set, not the size
of the universe). The benefit of this approach (in comparison to a classic
set implementation) is that the constant factors will be a lot better. The
disadvantage is that it uses **a lot** of memory. Another disadvantage is that
you can only use this approach when you can consecutively number the elements in
the universe.
