This weekend, I finished a silly little game in
[PureScript](http://www.purescript.org/) called Beeraffe.
You can [play it here](https://jaspervdj.be/beeraffe/) and
[view the source code here](https://github.com/jaspervdj/beeraffe/).  In this
blogpost, I want to give some more background information on how this game
came to be.

# Why PureScript?

If I was going to build a game, I knew I wanted it to be web-based -- there was
no doubt in mind about this:

 -  It makes it much easier to show it to other people; you can just share a
    link and they can be playing it in _seconds_.
 -  It is inherently cross-platform, and with a little bit of extra attention it
    easily works on smartphones as well.
 -  It is a good sandbox; you don't need to ask people to install arbitrary
    executables on their system.

There are of course some downsides to web-based games as well. For me, the main
disavantage is that the dominant language is still JavaScript (which I am not a
big fan of, to put it mildly).

Fortunately there are a good number of languages that compile down to JavaScript
these days.  The two big contendors were Haskell (through
[GHCJS](https://github.com/ghcjs/ghcjs)) and PureScript (I would go as far as
calling PureScript a Haskell dialect, since they are so similar).

The big advantage of using GHCJS is that you're able to run Haskell on the
backend _and_ on the frontend, so you can share common code.

However, I wanted to write a simple game without any sort of backend (which, of
course, makes it significantly easier to host as well).  PureScript produces
vastly smaller JavaScript files, and I wanted to learn the language a bit to
see how it compares with Haskell, so I decided to give that a try.

I did not consider [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) because it's a bit further
removed from Haskell, and my main focus was still building a game; not learning
a new language.  I have heard a lot of good things about it though, so maybe
that's what I should try next.

# Original inspiration for the game

One of the last games I played was the remake of the masterpiece
[Katamari Damacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katamari_Damacy) on the
[Nintendo Switch](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/katamari-damacy-reroll-switch).

</div>

Inspired by Katamari Damacy, I wanted to make a 2D version that had a similar
feeling to it.  I decided relatively quickly that the core mechanic of the game
would be to put different kinds of objects together in bizarre ways, hopefully
amusing people along the way.

# Putting sprites together

With that in mind, I immediately focused on this core mechanic since I wanted to
know whether it could actually be fun or not.

I started by doing a simple exhaustive search over all the ways you can overlay
two sprites, minimizing the average
[colour distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_difference).  This worked
remarkably well, and I didn't end up fine-tuning the results much more after
that.

It did lead to some performance issues for larger sprites, so I fixed that by
[mipmapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mipmap): for larger sprites, I first
do an exhaustive search at a much lower resolution, then I use these results to
do a local search in that neighbourhood at higher resolutions.  This is not
guaranteed to give the best results; but that doesn't matter too much for this
game: we just want a _good enough_ result.

I wanted to also try an approach based on
[simulated annealing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing) but
didn't get around to it.  If someone wants to try this, you're more than welcome
to make a contribution!

At this point, I was getting amusing results, but I wasn't sure how to make this
into a game yet.  I didn't want to make it into action game, and felt like a
puzzle game would fit better.  Then, I realized the comedic effect would be even
better if I combined the names of the different sprites as well.

This automatically adds a sort of puzzle mechanic to the game as well, since you
can now only merge certain objects.

# Finding resources

This brought me to the next obstacle -- I knew I would need a large number of
consistent sprites to use as art in the game.  I browsed around
[opengameart.org](https://opengameart.org/) for a bit, but did not really find
anything promising.  I also did not want to pay an artist, because I wanted to
keep this a free game, without advertisements and the like.

Then it dawned to me that there already is a great collection of consistent
sprites that even come with the names attached to them -- emoji!  I found the
free [EmojiOne](https://www.emojione.com/) set and started with that.  But when
I looked into it a bit, I found this weird snippet in their free licensing info:

> 3.4  What can’t you do with the JoyPixels/EmojiOne Properties under this
> agreement?  
> ...  
> (I) Include properties in open source projects.  
> ...

What nonsense is this?  I am allowed to use it in my non-commercial project if I
give attribution, but not if I want to have the option to open source my game?

This pissed me off and I started looking for alternatives.  At that point,
however, I already knew emoji were a good direction so it was easier.  I ended
up switching to [Google's Noto font](https://github.com/googlei18n/noto-emoji).
I liked the sprites a little bit less but at least the license made sense.

# Making it a real game

At this point I built a demo that simply allowed you to drag around a bunch of
different objects and merge them.  It was certainly amusing, but it did not
really feel like a "game" to me yet.  However, I shared this demo with a couple
of people and they all really liked it.  This was very encouraging.

The next weekend, I tried to turn this into a Tetris- or 2048-like puzzle game,
but this ended up being very confusing and not that much fun.  Ironically, the
non-game was more fun!

So, I decided to go back to that and just add a very simple economy on top of it
(buying and selling things) to make it a bit more interesting.  After I added
that, I was quite happy with the flow of the game.

The rules were still a bit unclear to people I showed it to (what things
can you merge together?), so I added the hints at the top of the cards and an
interactive tutorial.

# Closing thoughts on PureScript

In retrospect, I am happy with PureScript as a language and would recommend it
if you're looking into putting a simple no-backend web-based game together, and
you already know Haskell.

There were a few issues I ran into with the language:

 -  I still prefer lazy languages, and this bit me a few times.  In particular,
    I wrote a few monadic recursive functions without being aware of the
    [tailrec](https://github.com/purescript/purescript-tailrec) package.  This
    caused stack overflows in my code, but I only saw these on my phone, which
    made it extremely hard to debug.

 -  The error messages that the compiler emits are horrible at times.  I feel
    like this is an area where I could contribute a bunch of code myself, but
    I'm not sure if I'll ever have time for that.

There are also a lot of things I like:

 -  Working with the FFI to call JavaScript is seamless and easy.

 -  [Halogen](https://github.com/slamdata/purescript-halogen) is an amazing
    framework that made building the UI trivial.

 -  Once you figure out how to, the resulting JavaScript is actually very easy
    to debug using Firefox's or Chromium's developer tools.
