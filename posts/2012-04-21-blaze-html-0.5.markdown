After some work here at [UHac], I'm releasing a new version of the [blaze-html]
library. It has a number of changes, some of which slightly break compatibility
with older versions of the library.

## blaze-markup and blaze-svg

A few weeks ago, [Deepak Jois] emailed me that he would like to create a
`blaze-html` package for [SVG]. He started doing so by first simply copying the
`blaze-html` code and creating [blaze-svg] from there.

[Deepak Jois]: http://www.deepak.jois.name/
[SVG]: http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics
[blaze-svg]: https://github.com/deepakjois/blaze-svg

Obviously, `blaze-html` and `blaze-svg` contained *a lot* of common code, so we
(mostly Deepak, he really deserves all credit for this) extracted the shared
code into a new [blaze-markup] package, upon which both packages now depend.

## Backwards-incompatible changes

This move introduced some backwards-incompatible changes, which we catch with
deprecation warnings in a few places, but there have also been some module
changes, which might break your code when you upgrade.

The `Text.Blaze` module no longer contains an `Html` type. Instead, it has a
`Markup` type. However, in `Text.Blaze.Html`, we have

~~~~~{.haskell}
type Html = Markup
~~~~~

so the best way to upgrade is to change every `Text.Blaze` import into a
`Text.Blaze.Html` import.

Additionally, the `renderHtml` methods have been renamed to `renderMarkup`. When
you use a `renderHtml` method, you will see a deprecation warning. The best way
to resolve this warning is to import e.g., `Text.Blaze.Html.Renderer.Utf8`
instead of `Text.Blaze.Renderer.Utf8`.

## Easier creation of custom nodes

`blaze-html` 0.5 introduces easy creation of custom nodes. In the following
snippet, `test1` and `test2` generate the same HTML:

~~~~~{.haskell}
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
import Text.Blaze.Html (Html)
import Text.Blaze.Html5 (p)
import Text.Blaze.Internal

test1 :: Html
test1 = p "Hello world"

test2 :: Html
test2 = customParent "p" "Hello world"
~~~~~

However, you should void usage of `customParent` (and `customLeaf`,
`customAttribute`) whenever possible, which is why they are placed in the
`Text.Blaze.Internal` module. They are *much* slower than their regular
counterparts, and also less safe since they're vulnerable to typos.

## Simple manipulations of the HTML tree

I've also decided I will add some very simple manipulations of the HTML tree
when needed. For now, a single manipulation `contents` is included, since
another package (to be released in the future) depends on it.

This very fast function takes the text content of the HTML tree, so it is
available for rendering. Let's look at a simple example:

~~~~~{.haskell}
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
import Text.Blaze.Html (Html, contents, (!))
import Text.Blaze.Html.Renderer.Utf8 (renderHtml)
import qualified Text.Blaze.Html5 as H
import qualified Text.Blaze.Html5.Attributes as A

test :: Html
test = do
    H.p "Hello "
    H.img ! A.src "foo.png"
    H.p "World!"

-- Renders: <p>Hello </p><img src=\"foo.png\"><p>World!</p>
test1 = renderHtml test

-- Renders "Hello World!"
test2 = renderHtml $ contents test
~~~~~

## Installation

You can install the new version just by running

~~~~~
cabal update && cabal install blaze-html
~~~~~

You should definitely contact me if you run into any trouble, I'll try to get
back to you as fast as possible. In the meanwhile, I'm going to enjoy the rest
of the Utrecht Hackathon!
