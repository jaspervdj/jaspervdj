# Introduction

[GHC] comes with some [amazing tools] to do profiling of Haskell programs. In
`.prof` files, you can see exactly in which function most time is spent and
where most allocation is done.

[GHC]: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/
[amazing tools]: http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/profiling-and-optimization.html

However, at [Erudify], we have a huge amount of Haskell code -- and at this
point `.prof` files can become very unwieldy, and the text representation is
harder to grok.

This is why I coded [profiteur], a simple HTML-based visualiser for GHC `.prof`
files.

# Installation

Installation is easy:

    $ cabal install profiteur

# Usage

Let us grab a [sample program] from the [HaskellWiki]. The code of this sample
program can be found in the appendix. I saved this file as `binary-trees.hs`.

[sample program]: http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Shootout/Binary_trees
[HaskellWiki]: http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell

First, we compile it with profiling enabled:

    $ ghc --make -auto-all -prof -rtsopts binary-trees.hs
    [1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( binary-trees.hs, binary-trees.o )
    Linking binary-trees ...

We run it in profiling mode:

    $ ./binary-trees 10 +RTS -p -RTS
    stretch tree of depth 11     check: -1
    2048     trees of depth 4    check: -2048
    512  trees of depth 6    check: -512
    128  trees of depth 8    check: -128
    32   trees of depth 10   check: -32
    long lived tree of depth 10  check: -1

This generates the file `binary-trees.prof`. We can pass that to `profiteur`:

    $ profiteur binary-trees.prof
    Wrote binary-trees.prof.html

Open the resulting file in your favorite (modern) browser and you are good to
go! [Here is the resulting HTML file] so you can have a look without installing
`profiteur`.

[Here is the resulting HTML file]: /files/binary-trees.prof.html

As always, patches and pull requests are welcome on [GitHub].
