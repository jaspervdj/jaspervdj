# What is this about

Arrows are, like Monads or Monoids, a mathematical concept that can be used in
the Haskell programming language. This post analyzes and explains a certain use
case for Arrows, namely dependency tracking. But let's begin with a quite
unrelated quote from Jimi Hendrix.

Arrows are less common than Monads or Monoids (in Haskell code, that is), but
they are certainly not harder to understand. This blogpost aims to give a quick,
informal introduction to Arrows. As concrete subject and example, we use
dependency handling in Hakyll.

# The problem

[Hakyll] is a static site generator I use to run this blog. The principles
behind it are pretty simple: you write your pages in markdown or something
similar, and you write templates in html. Then, you render the pages with some
templates using a configuration DSL.

[Hakyll]: http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll

In Hakyll, the rendering algorithm is more or less like this:

- Read a page from a file, say `contact.markdown`.
- Parse and render this page to HTML using [pandoc].
- Do some further manipulations on the result.
- Render the result using a HTML template.
- Write the result to `_site/contact.html`.

[pandoc]: http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/

The catch is, say `_site/contact.html` is "newer" than `contact.markdown` and
the HTML templates. In this case, we do not want to do anything. Haskell
lazyness will not help us a lot here, since we're dealing with a lot of `IO`
code.

Suppose we're currently reading the page from a file. We know the timestamp of
the file we're reading, but since we don't yet know the timestamp of the other
files on which the final result depends, we don't know if we can skip this read
or not. This means dependency handling should happen on a higher level, above
these specific functions -- so we need to abstract dependency handling.

# A general notion of computation

So let's create a wrapper for functions dealing with dependencies.

~~~~~{.haskell}
data HakyllAction a b = HakyllAction
    { actionDependencies :: [FilePath]
    , actionUrl          :: Maybe (Hakyll FilePath)
    , actionFunction     :: a -> Hakyll b
    }
~~~~~

Some explanation might be needed here. You can think of `a` as the input for our
action, and then `b` is the output. The `actionUrl` contains the final
destination of our computations -- this can be `Nothing`, if it is not yet
known. And finally, the `actionFunction` contains the actual action.

The `Hakyll` is a usual monad stack with `IO` at the bottom.

# Categories

To qualify as an `Arrow`, a datatype needs to be a `Category`. So lets create
an `instance Category HakyllAction` first. There are two functions we need to
implement:

- `id`: The simple identity category. This is comparable to the `Prelude.id`
  function.
- `.`: Category composition -- this is comparable to function composition.

The `id` action has no dependencies, no destination, and simply returns itself.

~~~~~{.haskell}
instance Category HakyllAction where
    id = HakyllAction
        { actionDependencies = []
        , actionUrl          = Nothing
        , actionFunction     = return
        }
~~~~~

The `.` action is not complicated either. The new dependencies consist of all
the dependencies of the two actions. For our destination, we use an `mplus` with
the latest applied function first, so it gets chosen over the other destination.

~~~~~{.haskell}
    x . y = HakyllAction
        { actionDependencies = actionDependencies x ++ actionDependencies y
        , actionUrl          = actionUrl x `mplus` actionUrl y
        , actionFunction     = actionFunction x <=< actionFunction y
        }
~~~~~

The `<=<` operator is [right-to-left monad composition].

[right-to-left monad composition]: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/base/Control-Monad.html#v%3A%3C%3D%3C

# Arrows

To make our action a real `Arrow`, we need to implement two more functions:

- `arr`: This should lift a pure function (thus, with an `a -> b` signature)
  into `HakyllAction`, so we have the type signature
  `(a -> b) -> HakyllAction a b`.
- `first`: This is a function that should operate on one value of a tuple. This
  all happens "inside" `HakyllAction` -- perhaps an illustration will explain
  this better. You can see how `f :: a -> b` applies to an `(a, c)` tuple, where
  `f` is applied on the first value.

![Illustration of arrow first](/images/2010-03-26-first.png)

~~~~~{.haskell}
instance Arrow HakyllAction where
    arr f = id { actionFunction = return . f}
    first x = x
        { actionFunction = \(y, z) -> do
            y' <- actionFunction x y
            return (y', z)
        }
~~~~~

# Actually using it

Now that we've put all this trouble into creating an Arrow, we might as well use
it. Let's examine some functions from Hakyll and see how they fit.

~~~~~{.haskell}
createPage :: FilePath -> HakyllAction () Context
render     :: FilePath -> HakyllAction Context Context
writePage  :: HakyllAction Context ()
~~~~~

Arrows are usually combined using the `>>>` operator. This gives us:

~~~~~{.haskell}
test =   createPage "contact.markdown"
     >>> render "templates/default.html"
     >>> writePage
~~~~~

This creates a `HakyllAction` but doesn't actually do anything. We still need
to run it. And now we can see the benefits of this method, since we can write
a function that does dependency checking on the combined functions.

~~~~~{.haskell}
runHakyllActionIfNeeded test
~~~~~

The actual implementation of `runHakyllActionIfNeeded` goes more or less like
this:

~~~~~{.haskell}
runHakyllActionIfNeeded :: HakyllAction () ()
                        -> Hakyll ()
runHakyllActionIfNeeded action = do
    url <- case actionUrl action of
        (Just u) -> u
        Nothing  -> error "At this time, an URL should be set!"
    valid <- isFileMoreRecent url $ actionDependencies action
    unless valid (actionFunction action ())
~~~~~

The `isFileMoreRecent` function checks if the first file is more recent than all
of the other files.

# Profit!

We have now developped a more robust and better dependency checking system, and
learned something about Arrows. If you are interested, the complete code that
led to this blogpost is available on [here] on GitHub. There are also a few
other interesting things to consider:

[here]: http://github.com/jaspervdj/Hakyll/blob/master/src/Text/Hakyll/HakyllAction.hs

- Can you prove the Arrows/Category [laws] on `HakyllAction`?
- Why can't this be done using Monads?

These questions are left as an exercise to the reader. On a sidenote, kudos to
BCoppens for proofreading through this post.
