Tomorrow I'll be going to
[the third edition of BarcampGhent](http://twikilist.com/barcampghent).
It's the first barcamp I'm going to, and I'm rather looking forward to it.
After reading through the list of presentations a few times, I picked a few
items I'd certainly like to see.

## Presentations I want to see

- Old Media vs. New Media by [Bart De Waele](http://www.netlash.com/). 
  The subject he picked seems very interesting and I'd like to know what
  he (as the founder of [netlash](http://www.netlash.com/), and someone very
  actively participating in social media) thinks about it. Additionally,
  I have seen a presentation of Bart before, on an event organised by
  [Zeus WPI](http://zeus.ugent.be/), and he certainly is a good speaker.
- NoSQL by [Steven Noels](http://twitter.com/stevenn). Simply said, I don't
  know anything at all about NoSQL, and this seems like a good chance to learn.
- Something about [RSI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_strain_injury)
  by [Michaël Rosseel](http://www.retaggr.com/Card/michlr). Relevant for
  someone like me who spends _a lot_ of time behind his computer.
- How to commit a crime and get away with it by
  [Koen Delvaux](http://delvauxkoen.blogspot.com/). Because the title sounds
  awesome.

## What I will be presenting

I'm going to do a presentation called _learn you a haskell in 20 minutes_. It
will be a basic introduction to the functional programming language
[Haskell](http://haskell.org/). It won't be a _classic_ basic introduction, I'm
going to explain some none-trivial things. That's because all so called
_"simple introductions"_ I've seen were pretty boring. So I'm going to try
something different: I'll introduce some more advanced concepts instead using a
simple application I wrote.

In other words, my goal is not to teach you some basic Haskell concepts in 20
minutes, but rather to spark your interest in functional programming languages.
Let's hope this works!

Your most humble and obedient servant,
Jasper Van der Jeugt
