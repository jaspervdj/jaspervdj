# Introduction

Last month, I graduated from [Ghent University]. This seems like an excellent
time to review all the courses I took, and I hope this might be useful to future
or current UGent Computer Science students.

# First year

We only had mandatory courses in our first year.

## Mandatory courses

**Algorithms and Data Structures I**: (*Algoritmen en datastructuren I*): Quite
simply a solid first course on algorithms and data structures.

**Applied Formal Logic I** (*Toegepaste formele logica I*): Some parts about
lambda calculus, and some on simple logic laws. Elementary.

**Calculus I** (*Analyse I*): It was a calculus course. It was quite boring.

**Communication skills** (*Communicatievaardigheden*): This seems to be widely
regarded as a useless course. However, I have given quite a few talks in the
past few years, and I do think this course has definitely improved my skills
when it comes to making slides.

**Computer usage** (*Computergebruik*): This course teaches some UNIX and
command-line basics. The exercises and practical exam focus on esoteric problems
which are hard to solve using the given tools. While this makes it challenging
and interesting, the course comes with a big "Do Not Try This Stuff For
Real"-warning.

**Discrete mathematics** (*Discrete wiskunde*): Quite interesting, I guess. Kind
of hard as well.

**Laws of Intellectual Property** (*Recht van de intellectuele eigendom*): The
only mandatory law course in the Computer Science program. It's well-taught but
the subject remains plain and boring.

**Linear Algebra and Geometry** (*Lineaire algebra en meetkunde*): I feel like
this is a really interesting, vastly underrated course at UGent. The main
problem with this course is that all exercises, and even the exam, could be
solved by copy-pasting previous or example exercises. Hence, no one even
bothered to really study this.

**Programming I** (*Programmeren I*): Really teaches Java instead of
"Programming". I also think this course suffers a bit from an
*Everything-Is-An-Object-Even-When-It-Isn't*-symptom. I believe it would be more
useful to start out with simple procedural programming and teach that well, then
introduce Object-Oriented programming later as a natural transition by coupling
datatypes and related procedures.

**Programming II** (*Programmeren II*): This course was basically about two
things: the Swing framework and the corresponding interpretation of
Model-View-Controller. I don't think a lot of interesting materials are taught
here. However, this course came with a project, which yielded valuable
programming experience.

**Scripting Languages** (*Scriptingtalen*): Basically the continuation of
*Computer usage*. Made us do seemingly impossible stuff with arcane tools (think
XML processing with `sed` and `awk`). This made the course fun but I'm not sure
if it was that useful, since I hardly remember anything about `awk` and only
use simple `sed` commands (as opposed to the stuff we had to pull off during the
exercises -- *whaddup, hold buffer?*).

# Second year

In our second year, we were allowed to choose a single optional course.

## Mandatory courses

**Algorithms and Data Structures II**: (*Algoritmen en datastructuren II*):
Largely a continuation of *Algorithms and Data Structures I*. More algorithms,
more data structures. Not a bad course.

**Applied Formal Logic II** (*Toegepaste formele logica II*): I actually do not
quite remember anything specific that I learned in this course. This course
seems mostly unnecessary.

**Calculus II** (*Analyse II*): See *Calculus I*: same shit, different year.

**Computer Architecture** (*Computerarchitectuur*): This teaches some essential
basics of how a computer works. I feel like this course belongs in the first
year rather than the second year.

**Databases** (*Databanken*): I think this course should be called "History of
Databases: Where we start out with ancient history and end in the 90s!".

**Software Development I** (*Software-ontwikkeling I*): I already wrote a post
on this course, which can be found
[here](/posts/2010-01-20-software-development-i-impressions.html). The gist of
it is that we were taught some C and C++ in this course. To quote [Ron Swanson]:
"Never half-ass two things: whole-ass one thing".

[Ron Swanson]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Swanson

**Software Development II** (*Software-ontwikkeling II*): In this course, we had
to do a small project with a team. That was really interesting and we learned a
whole bunch from it. In the end, the teaching assistants graded the project
without judging the internal design of the project, which we thought was quite
lame. In addition to this project, there were some lessons and lab sessions.
Both were useless and uninteresting.

**Multimedia** (*Multimedia*): Some important multimedia fundamentals,
supplemented by a collection of mildly interesting trivia on widely used formats
such as [VRML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VRML).

**Probability Calculus and Statistics** (*Waarschijnlijkheidsrekenen en
statistiek*): Another fundamental but kind of dull course.

## Optional courses

**Introduction to Bio-informatics** (*Introductie in de bio-informatica*): I
chose this course because I thought it would be challenging and interesting. It
turned about to be only slightly interesting and much less practical than I had
hoped. I vaguely remember searching online databases for property X of protein Y
without even knowing what X or Y was. Hell, I still barely even know what a
protein is. I recommend only taking this course if you have a real interest in
biology.

# Third year

## Mandatory courses

**Algorithms and Data Structures III**: (*Algoritmen en datastructuren III*):
See *Algorithms and Data Structures I* and *II*. My main complaint on this
course is that the chapter on distributed algorithms seemed to dated from a time
in which distributed algorithms were not actually used. Yep.

**Communication Networks** (*Communicatienetwerken*): This was a pretty useful
one. Some stuff on networks, and commonly used protocols on different layers
such as IP, TCP/UDP, HTTP. The more advanced topics included IPv6, IPSEC and
VPN. The lab sessions were very well set-up and intriguing.

**Data Communication** (*Datacommunicatie*): Definitely deserves a nomination
for all-round worst course in the program. The subjects are dull and they are
taught in a deadening way. Attending the exercise sessions is an utter waste
of time. The exam included solving an massively huge but simple exercise: I
can't remember exactly what it was but I guess it compares to multiplying a
few 10x10 matrices with pen and paper: clearly the best way to check that
one understands matrix multiplication.

**Introduction to Electrical Engineering** (*Introductie tot elektrotechniek*):
This course was pretty hard and I am still undecided on whether this should or
should not be a mandatory course -- most of it seems only related in a very
indirect way. Nonetheless, I kind of enjoyed knowing a bit more about this
stuff, although I forgot most of it soon afterwards.

**Cross-Course Project** (*Vakoverschijdend project*): Build a simple webapp. A
pretty nice experience, altough building a such a project over 12 weeks makes
you focus on *Get Stuff Done* rather than *Do Stuff The Right Way*. Makes you
dislike your team because they're all incompetent.

**Internet Technology** (*Internettechnologie*): Quite simple, completely
useless.

**Formal Languages, Automata, Complexity** (*Formele talen, automaten,
complexiteit*): I thought this was a dull course, but I remember a number of
concepts we saw in this course (e.g. the distinctions between regular and
context free languages, the halting problem) really clearly so I guess it was
not bad after all.

**Scientific Computing** (*Wetenschappelijk rekenen*): Well-taught and quite
interesting. I barely remember anything from this course though: except the fact
that numerical computing can be hard even when it seems easy. Therefore, one
should just use existing libraries and applications.

## Optional courses

**Economy** (*Economy*): Probably one of the easiest courses at UGent. I was
doing a lot of open-source development and other exciting stuff at this time so
I didn't want to waste too much time with another course. Well, I never attended
any lessons and studied less than two days as exam preparation -- so I think it
deserves the title.

**Programming Languages** (*Programmeertalen*): This course simply boils down to
reading [Concepts, Techniques, and Models of Computer
Programming](http://www.info.ucl.ac.be/~pvr/book.html) and programming a bit in
[Oz]. But hey, it's a really good book, and Oz is a fun language.
