One of my favorite hobbies is skateboarding, and I especially enjoy doing
freeride. We have some reasonably nice spots to practice this great sport here
in Ghent: steep streets with little traffic.

So earlier tonight, I was practicing some slides with a friend. As we were
walking up the hill again at some point, a police officer, who had seen us going
down and parked his car, called us. The conversation went more or less like this
(in Dutch, obviously):

> Officer: "You know you can't skate on the driving lane, right?"  
> Me: "Actually, I think we are allowed to skate on the driving lane."  
> Officer: "Why do you think so?"  
> Me: "It says so in the royal decree of February 2007"  
> Officer: "... does it? What does it say?"  

I paraphrased the contents of that decree ([dutch article here]) -- I had read
this attentively after a previous run-in with the police on the same subject
(but in Lokeren).

[dutch article here]: http://www.wegcode.be/actueel/recente-wijzigingen/1260-voortbewegingstoestellen

The gist of it is that *voortbewegingstoestellen* (En.: transportation devices)
are subject to the same rules as bicycles iff they move at a speed considerably
faster than pedestrians. This law makes a lot of sense to me: moving at a fast
speed on a sidewalk is dangerous for skaters as well as pedestrians. It also
implies you should wear lights at night, stay in your lane, know how to
brake...: these are all good measures, meant to protect you.

Let's not elaborate about the mind-boggling fact that the police officer was not
familiar with the law he is paid to enforce, and continue with the actually
interesting part of the story.

After my explanation, the officer said he was surprised that I knew so much about
this law. He continued to say that given this fact, I must surely know that he
could subject me to a drug and alcohol test as well. I was obviously not under
the influence of any drugs and said that I would take such tests if required.

I was a bit annoyed that he asked this since there was no reason whatsoever to
suspect I would be under the influence of any drugs: hence, it felt more like
some kind of personal revenge.

Continuing in this mindset, he claimed that we seriously risked damaging the
parked cars in that street. I won't go into waste-of-time what-if scenarios in
this blogpost: I won't deny there indeed is *some* risk... just as there is some
risk when you're riding a bike or a car. I politely explained that if anything
were to happen we would simply bear the consequences and pay for the damages,
either through insurance or by ourselves, just like anyone else.

However, he didn't really seem satisfied with that answer, wrote down my name
and ensured us that if any damages were to occur, he would find me (maybe since
he has proof enough, right?). At that point, it almost seemed like he first
found *people* to blame, and only then an *offense* they were guilty of --
instead of the other way around.

After we said our goodbyes and he left, we continued skating for a bit. We went
home shortly afterwards, with slightly less confidence in the competence of the
police force.

**TL;DR:**

- Wear lights, stay in your line, know how to brake
- Know your rights
- Skate safe, skate hard!
