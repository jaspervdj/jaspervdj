# What is this

This is a blogpost version of a talk I recently gave at the [DutchHUG], about
BlazeHtml, a "blazingly fast HTML combinator library". This project was
accepted for Google Summer of Code, so I thought I'd blog it, too.

# What is BlazeHtml

About one month ago, [a discussion] took place on the Haskell web-devel mailing
list. In the mail I link too, Chris Eidhof describes what he wants to see in the
Haskell web-devel neighbourhood. Not much later, a [ticket] is created for
Google Summer of Code by Johan Tibbel.

[a discussion]: http://www.haskell.org/pipermail/web-devel/2010/000096.html
[ticket]: http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/summer-of-code/ticket/1580

I was quite interested in this idea from the start, so because I was attending
[ZuriHac], I started a [project] on GitHub to do some work in this direction.

[ZuriHac]: http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/ZuriHac
[project]: http://github.com/jaspervdj/BlazeHtml

This project turned out to be more popular on ZuriHac than I had initially
expected -- I got the help from 7 awesome Haskellers: Chris Done, Fred Ross,
Jim Whitehead, Harald Holtmann, Oliver Mueller, Simon Meier and Tom Harper.

![Us hacking on ZuriHac](/images/2010-04-28-zurihac.jpg)

Together, we produced an initial, prototype version of BlazeHtml. We focused
on abstraction as well as performance... and I'm afraid we wanted to do too much
at once. With pain in my heart, I had to throw a lot of code away and make a 
fresh start after ZuriHac. But this does not mean the code we wrote was not 
useful: I will reintegrate big parts of it later, and it was a very useful 
learning experience.

# The actual problem

Let's define the actual problem more precisely. We want to write abstract 
descriptions of Html documents built from content and atttributes represented 
both as `String` as well as `Data.Text` values, since both types are common 
representations of sequences of Unicode characters in Haskell programs.

We want to render these documents to a sequence of bytes represented as a lazy
`ByteString`. The chunks of such a lazy `ByteString` should be "big enough" in
order to be efficient in later progressing, like sending the render
[over a socket] or [writing it to a file].

[over a socket]: http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/network-bytestring/0.1.2.1/doc/html/Network-Socket-ByteString-Lazy.html
[writing it to a file]: http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/bytestring/0.9.1.6/doc/html/Data-ByteString-Lazy.html#v%3AwriteFile

For now, we fix the output encoding to UTF-8, for two reasons:

- We first want to get a performance baseline. This way we can precisely
  determine what later abstractions cost.
- UTF-8 supports Unicode and is widely used and recommended for web pages.

# Current state

So, what is the current state of our library? After having tried different
design paths, we now have an implementation that is fast. With this baseline
performance, I hope to continue. The question, of course, is how fast it
exactly is.

The "Big Table" benchmark is a very simple microbenchmark, implemented in many
different templating engines. It times the rendering of a big `<table>`. This
table has 1000 rows and 10 columns, and every row has the simple content 1, 2,
3, ... 10.

The different templating engines tested are:

- [Spitfire](http://code.google.com/p/spitfire/)
- [ClearSilver](http://www.clearsilver.net/)
- [ERB](http://corelib.rubyonrails.org/classes/ERB.html)
- [Erubis](http://www.kuwata-lab.com/erubis/)
- Our own BlazeHtml.

![BigTable benchmarks](/images/2010-04-28-benchmarks.png)

For the record, all benchmarks are run on a Intel CPU T2080 @ 1.73GHz. As you
can see, BlazeHtml is quite fast. I also tried some other Haskell libraries. I
will perform a more extensive benchmarking of the Haskell libraries available
from Hackage in the near feature. For now, you can see some initial results
here:

Although I have to say that this comparison is not quite fair. BlazeHtml
produces encoded strings, where the other packages produce just strings (which
still need to be encoded before sending them over the network).

The code used for these benchmarks can be found [in our repo]. Some benchmarks
were implemented by the spitfire team, they can be found [in their repo]. I
edited some of these benchmark so that all of them escape the table content,
in order to make a more fair comparison.

# Why is BlazeHtml fast

There are two design decisions underlying the speed that BlazeHtml features:

1. We avoid explicit intermediate data structures by using a
   continuation-passing style; i.e. our only intermediate data structures are
   closures, which are probably the best optimized data structures in a
   functional programming language like Haskell.

2. We copy each output byte at most once by using a mutable buffer encapsulated
   in a `Builder` monoid.

These two design decisions together with some well-chosen inlining resulted
already in a quite nice speed. What was missing then was fast writing of
individual bytes into a `Builder`: We were introducing too much overhead.
Every character was taken through an entire pipeline of functions that looked
more or less like

~~~~~{.haskell}
append . encode .  escape
~~~~~

What I wanted is to have these operations executed on some sort of stream rather
than on every character.  Originally, we were using the following function
(defined in `Data.Binary.Builder`) to create our `Builder` monoid:

~~~~~{.haskell}
singleton :: Word8 -> Builder
~~~~~

This function was called for every byte, introducing a severe overhead. I was
able to get significant speedups by defining the (manually fused) functions:

~~~~~{.haskell}
fromText :: Text -> Builder
fromUnescapedText :: Text -> Builder
fromString :: String -> Builder
~~~~~

These functions were defined in `Text.Blaze.Internal.Utf8Builder`. They all rely
on a small patch to `Data.Binary.Builder`, exposing the following function:

~~~~~{.haskell}
-- | /O(n)./ A Builder from a raw write to a pointer.
--
fromUnsafeWrite :: Int                  -- ^ Number of bytes to be written.
                -> (Ptr Word8 -> IO ()) -- ^ Function that does the write.
                -> Builder              -- ^ Resulting 'Builder'.
~~~~~

As you can see from this signature, we have some code here that some people
would consider "not elegant". Those people include me. However, we must not
forget that efficiency is our main goal. Besides, these functions are not
exported to the end user.

# The Future

So, that's it for now. You can expect more updates from me in the feature,
since I'll be working on this project with great enthusiasm now that it has been
accepted to Google Summer of Code 2010. Thanks to all the people who made this
possible!

This blogpost was partly based on the notes I make while developing. These
can be found [here]. I'd also like to thank Simon Meier for his continuous
stream of feedback.
