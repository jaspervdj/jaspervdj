# Introduction

So, last thursday I escaped Belgium for a bit and travelled to [Odessa] to
attend [OdHac], a Haskell Hackathon organised there by [Roman] and hosted by
[Provectus IT].

Odessa is a really sweet city. One thing I noticed is that while some of the
buildings seem to be in a deplorable condition from the outside, they actually
turn out to be very nice once you're indoors! This was for example the case for
the hostel I was staying in. The contrast is also seen elsewhere in the city,
with brand new appartements next to ramshackle, desolated houses.

This is, however, not the case for the very centre of the city -- around the
famous [Potemkin Stairs]. This neighbourhood is absolutely amazing.

# Hakyll at OdHac

At the Hackathon, I did a small presentation about [Hakyll] on friday, and some
awesome people decided to help me improve Hakyll a bit this weekend. We were
able to implement some exciting features.

## If-else conditionals in templates

We added some functionality to the Hakyll templates which you allows you to
check if a certain value is defined. We chose to use the same syntax as Pandoc,
to further ease integration:

[Pandoc]: http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/

    <h1>$title$</h1>
    $if(author)$
        <em>by $author$</em>
    $endif$

We also support if-else-endif. On the plane back, I also took the time to
implement `$foreach$` and `$partial$`.

## Teasers

Teasers allow you to write a short introduction for a blogpost, and make it easy
to reproduce this introduction on another page together with a "Read more" link.
We decided to implement the convention used in Wordpress, which means you define
your teasers using the following simple format:

    ---
    title: Some post
    ---

    This is the introduction.

    The rest of the post...

## Pagination

We also started to work on a generic Pagination module. It's not finished yet
but it should be possible to clean this up and package it by the end of the
week. I'm quite excited about this feature because lots of people have requested
it in the past.

Additionally, we did some performance improvements and fixed a bug or two. All
in all, a very productive and fun Hackathon! I hope to package up all these
changes and push them to Hackage soon.

Thanks for contributing to Hakyll, Alexey Smirnov, Anton Dubovik, Dmitriy
Shamatrin, Ivan Veselov and Pavel Poukh! And, of course, thanks for organizing,
Roman!
