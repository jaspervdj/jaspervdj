On November 5--7, 2010
[we](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Ghent_Functional_Programming_Group/)
hosted BelHac, the first Belgian Haskell Hackathon, kindly sponsored by
[Incubaid](http://www.incubaid.com), [Well-Typed](http://www.well-typed.com),
and [O'Reilly](http://www.oreilly.com).

On Friday, we started with a great introduction to Haskell by Miran Lipovaƒça,
the author of [Learn You a Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com). A lot of
students from Ghent University showed up for this tutorial -- it's good to see
that there is an interest in Haskell among students. In parallel, there was some
hacking, since some people already knew Haskell.

After that, we moved to another (more fancy) building to listen to talks by
Duncan Coutts, Romain Slootmaekers and Don Stewart.The talks all focused around
"Haskell in the Industry", and, quoting Don Stewart, "felt like startup school
for haskellers". Perhaps we'll see some new Haskell startups soon?

The talks were followed by a small reception, and after that, some obligatory
Belgian beers in nearby pubs.

On Saturday and Sunday, the focus was on hacking. We had a small contest: since
we had some shiny new Real World Haskell books to give away, we made a list of
people who uploaded a package to Hackage during the hackathon. On Sunday, three
lucky winners were chosen.

I think this hackathon was a success. Patches were added to cabal, to
the new Hackage, and, of course, a lot of packages were released. I
hope to see everyone again at the next Hackathon!
