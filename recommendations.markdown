# Recommendations

This is a fairly loose and very limited list of stuff I thoroughly enjoy.

## Music

I generally try to recommend less well-known artists, as far as that's possible
in today's information society. I've opted to only recommend albums or EPs
instead of songs.

- Bee Thousand by Guided By Voices (Indie rock)
- Blouse by Blouse (Dream pop?)
- Blue Scholars by Blue Scholars (Hip-hop)
- Eyelid Movies by Phantogram (Pop)
- Gas by Gas 0095 (Ambient)
- Guide To An Escape by Rue Royale (Folk)
- High Times by Washed Out (Downtempo)
- Lonerism by Tame Impala (Psychedelic)
- Loveless by My Bloody Valentine (Shoegaze)
- Metaphorical Music by Nujabes (Hiphop)
- Neveroddoreven by I Monster (Electronic)
- No Way Down by Air France (Dream pop?)
- On Claws by I Am Oak (Folk)
- Ravedeath, 1972 by Tim Hecker (Ambient)
