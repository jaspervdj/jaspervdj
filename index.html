    Hi! I am Jasper Van der Jeugt. I was born in 1990, and spent most of my
    youth in Lokeren &amp; Ghent, Belgium. I currently live in ZÃ¼rich and write
    code for companies such as <a href="http://fugue.co/">Fugue</a>,
    Bdellium and previously Better.  Before that, I studied Computer Science at
    <a href="http://ugent.be/">Ghent University</a> where I was very involved
    with
    <a href="https://zeus.ugent.be/">Zeus WPI</a> for a few years.
</p>

    Did I tell you I like to make stuff? I love to make stuff! That is why I am
    somewhat active in
    <a href="/cv.html#open-source-contributions">open source development</a>.
    My interests there revolve mostly around the
    <a href="http://haskell.org/">Haskell</a> programming language. In addition
    to building libraries and tools, I also sit on the
    <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Haskell.org_committee">Haskell.org committee</a>
    and I am one of the main organizers of a conference called
    <a href="http://zurihac.info/">ZuriHac</a>.
    Sometimes I like to write games.  Beeraffe is the last one I did, you can
    play that <a href="/beeraffe">in your browser here</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Apart from that, I have a very broad taste in music and movies, and I also
    love skateboarding and taking <a href="/photos.html">pictures</a>.
